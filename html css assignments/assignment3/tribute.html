         <li><span>1880</span> - Tesla Moves To Prague To Study Philosophy  He arrived late to enroll for classes, and his lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not qualify for the classes he wanted to take.

         <li><span>1882</span> - In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison Company.At this company, he improved his electrical engineering prowess. The management team noticed his abilities and soon introduced him as part of the team that would produce dynamos and motors.</li>
         <li><span>1885</span> - In March 1885, he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help in the submission of various patents.

         <li><span>1890</span> - After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling. This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.` He tried in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based on near field and capacitative coupling. He even performed various public demonstrations, where he would light up Geissler tubes to impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over a decade trying to come up with new solutions for lighting</li>
         <li><span>1891</span> - In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of the US. In the same year, he also patented his famous Tesla Coil.
